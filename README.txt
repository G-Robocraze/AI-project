Project Title: Bangalore House Price Prediction Web App

Project Overview:
The project aims to build a user-friendly web application that allows users to predict house prices in Bangalore based on specific features. The application utilizes a machine learning model trained on historical house price data to provide accurate predictions.

Project Components:

Data Preprocessing:
The project starts by preprocessing the house price dataset, which includes features like location, total square feet area, number of bathrooms, number of bedrooms, and price. The dataset is cleaned, and irrelevant columns are removed. Outliers are handled, and missing values are addressed.

Machine Learning Model:
The heart of the project is a machine learning model that predicts house prices based on the input features. A Linear Regression model is trained using the cleaned dataset. This model learns patterns from the historical data to make predictions.

Flask Web Application:
The Flask framework is used to create a web application that serves as the user interface. The application includes an HTML page with input fields for the user to provide information about the house. These inputs are sent to the Flask server for processing.

HTML Interface:
The web application's HTML interface provides a simple form where users can input details such as location, total square feet area, number of bathrooms, and number of bedrooms. When the user submits the form, the data is sent to the Flask server.

Model Prediction:
The Flask server processes the user's inputs and uses the trained Linear Regression model to predict the house price. The server retrieves the model and relevant data transformations, applies them to the user's inputs, and returns the predicted price.

Output Display:
The predicted house price is displayed on the web page, giving the user immediate feedback based on their input. This output provides users with an estimated price for the specified house based on the provided details.

Key Features and Technologies:

Flask: A lightweight Python web framework for building web applications.
HTML: Used to create the user interface for inputting data.
Linear Regression: The machine learning model used for price prediction.
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning, outlier handling, and data transformation for model compatibility.
User Flow:

Users access the web application through a browser.
They enter the location, total square feet area, number of bathrooms, and number of bedrooms for the house they are interested in.
Upon clicking "Predict," the inputs are sent to the Flask server.
The Flask server processes the inputs using the trained model and data transformations.
The predicted house price is sent back to the web page and displayed to the user.
Potential Enhancements:

Improved User Interface: Enhance the design and usability of the web page.
Error Handling: Implement error messages for invalid inputs or unexpected behavior.
Model Selection: Allow users to choose from different models for prediction.
Deployment: Deploy the application to a production server for public access.
Project Outcome:
The project provides users with a convenient way to estimate house prices in Bangalore based on key features. It showcases the integration of machine learning models with web development, giving users a hands-on experience of interacting with predictive algorithms.
